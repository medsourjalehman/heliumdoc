MediaSourcery KST3320: this is the file KST sent us with a sensors part name, serial number, etc. 
	for our purposes it lacks a Name field. We can make one by adding the pn and sn, an example is in the 
	included csv file. 
import devices to helium.csv: By making a column "Name" and populating it with pn + sn, we are giving each sensor
	a unique name. This is the format helium accepts, the field names are not case sensitive

pictures go in this order: 
import devices, (you can drag and drop csv file)
csv format, (explains required fields)
drag, drop and devices found, (after dragging and dropping this is what you see)
import status, (after import, given import status)
pending devices. (shows devices in devices list, pending as they are connecting. This takes a moment)
