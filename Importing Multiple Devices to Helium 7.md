# Importing Multiple Devices to Helium 

Helium allows you to import devices by dragging and dropping a csv file with sensor information. 

## Before you begin 

A spreadsheet from the vendor containing the following sensor information is needed.

- pn (sensor's part name)
- sn (serial number)
- DevEUI
- AppEUI
- AppKey  


## Format .csv file 

1. Create a .csv file with the following columns 

   -   pn 
   -   sn
   -   Name 
   -   DevEUI
   -   AppEUI
   -   AppKey

2. Create a unique name for each device by using pn+sn. You can do this quickly by using the excel formula __=A2&""&B2__. Use this information for the name column.
___Note___: field names are not case sensitive 

3. Complete all fields
